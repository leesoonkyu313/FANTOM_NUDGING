THIS IS AN EXAMPLE CODE UPDATING THE VERTICAL TEMPERATURE PROFILE (HYBRID-1W). NOTE THAT THE CODE ITSELF ONLY DEMONSTRATES THE WEIGHT UPDATING AT THE CURRENT TIME STEP. THE FULL CODE USED FOR NUDGING FANTOM-REFINED MODEL REQUIRES COMPLICATED LOGIC AND MASSIVE INPUT DATA, WHICH IS NOT PUBLICLY SHOWN.

## repository contents
1. performNudging.py: The core Python script implementing the BLUE algorithm; the execute block is in the same file
2. temperature_483840_514080_data_fetch.dat: observed data from 483840 to 514080
3. temperature_483840_514080_LSTM_output.dat: LSTM-1W output from 483840 to 514080
4. temperature_483840_514080_fantom_output.dat: FANTOM-REFINED output from 483840 to 514080

## how to run.
TO CALCULATE THE WEIGHTS and ERRORS, SIMPLY SET THE "nugde = False". THIS TELLS THE CODE TO CALCULATE WEIGHTS FROM THE PAST TIMESTEPS (CURRENT TIMESTEPS IN THIS CODE) 
MAKE SURE TO INSTALL THE REQUIRED LIBRARIES.

syntax: python performNudging.py
